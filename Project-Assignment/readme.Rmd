# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project

This project includes the following files:

* run_analysis.R : This file gets and cleans the data as instructed

* codebook.Rmd : This file explains the data and codes in run_analysis.R

* Tidy.txt : This file contains the resulting data of run_analysis.R.


## Steps to work on this course project

1. Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a ```UCI HAR Dataset``` folder.
2. Put ```run_analysis.R``` in the parent folder of ```UCI HAR Dataset```, then set it as your working directory using ```setwd()``` function in RStudio.
3. Run ```source("run_analysis.R")```, then it will generate a new file ```Tody.txt``` in your working directory.
